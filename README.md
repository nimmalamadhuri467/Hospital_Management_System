# Hospital_Management_System

## Overview
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the management of patients, doctors, departments, and health records in a hospital setting. Developed as a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) project using Python, this system efficiently incorporates core concepts of data management and algorithmic problem-solving. It allows for efficient patient tracking, symptom logging, task management, and medication interaction checks, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals while demonstrating the practical implementation of DSA principles.

## Features
- Patient Management: Add and manage patient records, including their health conditions, severity levels, and assigned doctors.
- Doctor Management: Secure login for doctors to view their assigned patients and manage their records.
- Symptom Tracker: Users can log symptoms, view their history, and receive alerts based on severity patterns.
- Health Card Management: Manage health cards, including maximum and remaining amounts for treatments.
- Task Management: Track tasks assigned to patients and manage task completions for discounts.
- Disease Prediction: Predict possible diseases based on logged symptoms.
- Food Recommendations: Get dietary recommendations based on specific health conditions.
- Medication Interaction Checker: Check for potential interactions between medications prescribed for different diseases.
- Reports Analyzer: Compare patient test results against normal ranges and generate health messages.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite for database management
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Deque and Linked List for data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Required libraries: `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-management-system.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd hospital-management-system
   
3. Install the required libraries:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
   
4. Run the application:
   bash
   python main.py
   

## Usage
1. Login:
   - Admins can add doctors and manage departments.
   - Doctors can securely log in to access their assigned patients.
2. Manage Patients:
   - Add new patients and update their health records.
   - Assign doctors and track health card usage.
3. Track Symptom:
   - Log patient symptoms and monitor severity trends.
4. Predict Diseases:
   - Utilize the system's algorithm to suggest possible conditions based on logged symptoms.
5. Analyze Reports:
   - Upload patient test results and compare them with normal ranges.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a web-based interface for remote access.
- Integrate machine learning for more accurate disease predictions.
- Support multi-language features for accessibility.
- Add a notification system for appointment reminders.
